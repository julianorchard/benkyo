I'm going to learn through the AJATT method.
Basically it involves (eventually) watching a lot
of media in the target language and retaining
vocabulary through SRS.

However, I'm not there yet! I need to Remember The
Kanji first.

At the moment, that's really all what's here; 

- Imagemagick Script to generate Kanji cards
- text and CSS files to store my theme nicely


## Imagemagick Script

If you want the script to run, you'll probably
need the fonts installed, otherwise it'll need
tweaking somewhat ;
