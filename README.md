Remembering The Kanji (RTK) is a method of
learning to recognise the roughly 2,200 Jōyō
kanji, where you [work through a
book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembering_the_Kanji_and_Remembering_the_Hanzi). 

This repo contains some scripts that generate some
nice looking [Anki
cards](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) which I'm using
to try and learn these characters! It also
contains some of the CSS and HTML used for the
cards. I've used
[ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) to create the kanji
images.

Although I do own a physical copy of the book, the list of kanji I used to make these cards was originally in [this Reddit
post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1a126a/all_2200_kanji_from_heisigs_remembering_the_kanji/).

## Running

If you want the script to run, you'll probably
need the fonts installed, otherwise it'll need
tweaking somewhat ;

- [Meiryo](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/meiryo)
- [Noto Serif JP](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Serif+JP)
- [Yuji Mai](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Yuji+Mai)
- [BIZ UDGothic](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/biz-udgothic)

If you're looking to run this script, it's
probably to generate new characters (otherwise you
can just [download the images I generated...](https://github.com/julianorchard/benkyo/releases/tag/2200)), so just
replace the file in [2200](2200) with the location you
want. Each character needs to be on a new line.
